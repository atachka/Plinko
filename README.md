# Description

Plinko Game
This project is a Plinko game built using TypeScript and PixiJS for animations.

The game allows users to interact with a simulated Plinko board, where a ball falls through a series of pegs, randomly bouncing until it reaches a slot at the bottom. The animations and physics were created using PixiJS, providing a smooth visual experience.
